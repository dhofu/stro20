# stro20
This repository contains the documentation for "STRO 2.0 - re-engineering Sound Toll Registers Online".
The repository consists of a number of jupyter notebooks and some additional materials.
If the notebooks are executed in order - from 0 to 4 (exploration first, then method), the data of STRO 2.0 should be found on your computer.
To access the STRO data in the new data model directly, please go to https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27176202.v2

Please note that the documentation was prepared on the basis of the original data files of Sound Toll Registers Online. These files were prepared on 29 December 2021 and downloaded from the website on 26 March 2024. In the meantime, some of the files have changed. To avoid issues with the notebooks, the legacy data from 29 December 2021 can be downloaded here: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27221169.v1
